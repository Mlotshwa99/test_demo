        <p>So after some solo overthinking (you know, no bestie to bounce things off 😅) and a lot of prayer, I feel peaceful enough to give this a try.

I’m still praying through it, but I’m open — as long as we keep God at the center. 🙏🏽
Let’s take it slow, stay honest, and enjoy the journey with grace (and maybe a few laughs too).
